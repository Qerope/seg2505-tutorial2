# SEG2505-Tutorial2

This repository contains the results of the second tutorial assignment for SEG2505. The task involved completing a series of Android development tutorials, progressively pushing the results to a GitHub repository. Each tutorial is organized in a separate subdirectory for clarity.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we worked through the following tasks:

1. **Create a simple application with textual composables**  
2. **Understand the lifecycle stages of an activity**  
3. **Implement a dropdown list**  
4. **Learn how to associate behavior with a click event**

These tutorials helped to solidify knowledge in Kotlin, Android development, and Jetpack Compose.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following subdirectories, each corresponding to a tutorial:

```
